# Language Dictionary

An android application that reads in a character(csv) separated value line by line.
I use the carrot^ as the default because that allows for reading in multiple phrases that used commans,
The file is read in everytime the application is created. The values are read into a database. 
The Foreign language column is unique so no duplicates are made.

Once the Application is generated in a device. It loads four different categories. 
The Categories are preset and use a Query statement that displays data based on the category defined in the database column.

- Android Studio (Recommended IDE) for running the application.
- Either use a virtual deveice generated by Android studio or Genymotion (personal edition)
